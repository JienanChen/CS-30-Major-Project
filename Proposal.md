# Major Project Proposal
This project is based on the PJM Productions film *La rédemption*. In this project, there exists two modes-Spasky and Charter-one less difficult than the other. In both modes, the objective is to locate the enemy (Blaviken von Everic) who is hidden in three different locations. Evidently, this system relies on a 2d-array, and the difficulty varies between the two modes due to the fact that in the spasky mode, the grid is a simple 3 x 3 grid, whereas one plays on an 8 x 8 grid. Once a Blaviken is found, the game digresses to a battle between either Spasky (if in the Spasky mode) and Blaviken, or between Charter (if in the Charter mode) and Blaviken. However, in the Spasky mode, if after three turns blaviken is still at large, you will have lost, having lost a turn every time you clicked on a grid thinking Blaviken was there and being proven otherwise. The same applies to the Charter mode. 

## Needs to Have List
1. An algorithm which can place the enemies in random spots (3 in the Spasky mode, 8 in the Charter mode).
2. 

## Nice to Have List
1. Start menu with a live background 
2. An introductory video which plays when the start button is poressed (ajmn excerpt from the motion picture  *La rédemption*)
3. A character selection menu with animations.
4. Music composed especially by Dr. Jienan Chen.
5. An algorithmn relying on a 2d-array system which landscapes the "playing field" with trees, mountains, puddles etc.
6. Spasky (Muhammad) and Charter (Jienan) sounds
7. Sound effects (! Spasky and Charter sounds)
8. Obstacles
   * Interactive animations and scenes
   * Mini games and fights
   * Consequences and rewards
9. A shop section
10. A character skill tree system
11. Campaign mode for story
