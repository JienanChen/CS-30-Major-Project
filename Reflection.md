## Code Related Problems
Before the final project was assigned, it was apparent to me that the 2D Array Project would be a good project to carry through as the final project. One of the big problems which I faced was with myidea of placing three enemies (Blavikens) within a 3 x 3 grid and eight enemies within an 8 x 8 grid, randomly. I thought that I could do it within  a 2D array, where it would loop through to find spots to place the enemy. However,t aht was a bust. I then tried using arrays, but that meant I had to create multiple arrays, which was not practical. Finally, with the assistance of my father, we came up with the method which we are using now, which only relies on one array,  although we also expererimented with the shuffle function for arrays, using a slightly different array.

The next problem I faced was also due to my idea for the project. Being a Chaplin nut, I wanted to intergrate clips from Chaplin films. Ultimately, i built the so called "Chaplin Film Player," but the problem I ran into wsa the fact that videos would often play simultaneously, one on top of another. It took me a Friday evening to figure out a solution: using a state for each video. By the end, I had a riduluous 22 states. Thus, this part of the project was abandoned. 

Thirdly, the game "Balviken's Lair" game me trouble. I had figured out the basics of the game, but put it off after the code could not detect whether I/the user was in collision with one the many latent boobytraps. However, my father pointed out that it was because I was not keeping track of the placements of the boobytraps. Thus, through arrays and array.push(), the problem was solved. Into these arrays went the x and y locations of these boobytraps.

Other problems I encountered had to do with the landscaping, playing sounds correctly, and having the webcam take a picture at the right moment.

## Technical Problems
For a little while in late May, for some reason, GitHub refused to work on my main computer at home. Every time I tried to pull the origin, it would respond with an error message. The problem resolved itself (it seems) a few days later. 

## Other Problems
Despite a contract and many hard and soft conversations which I had with him, my partner found himself pre-occupied. In the end, his work was of a lesser quality,and he essentailly forced me to take time to solve his problems.
