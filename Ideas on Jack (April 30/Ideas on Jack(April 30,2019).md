# Ideas on Jack

## Purpose of Jack
Jack will be hidden among the grids in the Charter mode. If Jack is not found, deceiver() will run. Else, deceiver() stops.

##deceiver();
deceiver() is a function.  It is acvtivated when the player has clicked on a grid containing a Blaviken. A "dice" will roll, that is to say random(1,101). If the random number is smaller than 50, then even if there is a Blaviken within the grid, the program will act as if no Blaviken has been found. Not until Jack is found can deceiver be deactivated, hence why Jack is known as "the deceiver."
